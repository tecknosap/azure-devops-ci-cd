# 3-Tier Web Application on Azure with Terraform

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **3-Tier Web Application** on **Microsoft Azure**, utilizing **Terraform** for automated infrastructure provisioning. The architecture is designed for **scalability**, **security**, and **high availability**.

### Architecture Overview:

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**: A **.NET web application** hosted on **Azure App Service**, serving the user interface.
2. **Application Tier (Backend)**: A **.NET backend** integrated with **Azure Key Vault** for secure configuration management and business logic.
3. **Data Tier**: A secure **Azure SQL Database** for data storage and management.

This architecture ensures separation of concerns, high scalability, and secure access management using Azure services and Terraform automation.

## Key Features

- **Terraform Automation**: Automates the entire infrastructure deployment process, ensuring consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled provisioning. This minimizes human errors and allows for efficient management of infrastructure at scale.
  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes **Azure App Service** for hosting the frontend and backend, **Azure SQL Database** for scalable data storage, and **Azure Key Vault** to securely manage application secrets.
  
- **Monitoring & Diagnostics**: Integrated with **Application Insights** for real-time application performance monitoring, and **Log Analytics** for centralized logging and troubleshooting, ensuring that issues are quickly identified and resolved.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements **RBAC** to enforce fine-grained access control, ensuring only authorized users and services can interact with sensitive resources such as databases and configuration secrets.

## Business Impact

This solution showcases the ability to deliver a **scalable**, **secure**, and **automated** cloud architecture, using **Terraform** to automate infrastructure management and **Azure services** for cloud-native reliability. The integration of key components like **Application Insights** and **RBAC** offers multiple business benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Terraform automates the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure, reducing the time and complexity of deployments.
- **Security**: Integration with **Azure Key Vault** and **RBAC** ensures that sensitive information is securely managed and that access is tightly controlled.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: With **Application Insights** and **Log Analytics**, organizations can monitor the health and performance of applications in real time, proactively identifying issues before they affect end users.

This architecture is an ideal choice for organizations looking to **optimize** their cloud environments, ensuring high availability, security, and scalability for their web applications.

This architecture separates concerns into three distinct layers:

1. **Frontend** (Presentation Tier): A **.NET** web application hosted on **Azure App Service**.
   
3. **Backend** (Application Tier): A **.NET backend** integrated with **Azure Key Vault** to manage configuration securely.
   
5. **Data** (Data Tier): A **Azure SQL Database** provides scalable and secure data storage.
   
7. **Monitoring & Diagnostics**: Real-time monitoring through **Application Insights** and centralized logging with **Log Analytics**.
