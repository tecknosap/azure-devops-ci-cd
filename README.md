# **3-Tier Web Application on Azure with Terraform**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates a **3-Tier Web Application** deployed on **Microsoft Azure** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The architecture is designed for scalability, security, and high availability, adhering to industry best practices.

### **Architecture Layers:**

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend):** A **.NET web application** hosted on **Azure App Service** to serve the user interface.
2. **Application Tier (Backend):** Implements business logic, interacts with the SQL Database, and manages secure configurations via **Azure Key Vault**.
3. **Data Tier:** A **SQL Database** hosted in **Azure SQL Database**, providing reliable and scalable data storage.

The deployment uses **Terraform** to ensure consistency, repeatability, and ease of management, while **Application Insights** and **Log Analytics** provide monitoring and diagnostics.

## **Key Features**

- **3-Tier Architecture:** Separation of concerns across presentation, application, and data layers.
- **Terraform Automation:** Ensures consistent, automated deployment of infrastructure.
- **Azure App Service:** Managed hosting with scalability for frontend and backend services.
- **Azure SQL Database:** Secure and scalable relational database for application data.
- **Azure Key Vault:** Centralized, secure storage for sensitive information like credentials.
- **Monitoring & Diagnostics:**
  - **Application Insights:** Real-time application performance monitoring.
  - **Log Analytics:** Aggregated logs and metrics for troubleshooting.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained access control for secure operations.
